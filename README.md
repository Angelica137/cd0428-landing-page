# Landing Page Project

This is a project to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript and is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Summary
The starter project was provided by Udacity and has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page.

The goals of this project are to convert this project from a static webpage to an interactive one with these requirements:

- A top navigation is dynamically created from the sections on the landing page
- Clicking on the navigation sections autoscrolls the user to the relevant section.
- Each section is styled to identify it as the active seciton when in view.
- Each section in the top navigation itself is highlghted when the section is active. 


Completeing this will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
